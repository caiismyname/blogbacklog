    p This tool allows you to delivery a series of extracted links regularly to your email, sort of like a time-shifted newsletter (but just the links, not the content behind them).
    p It's particularly useful for when you discover a blog with a history that you want to enjoy, but I'm sure you'll think of other uses as well.

    p To get started, enter the URL of the page that we'll extract links from:

    form(name="inputUrl", action="/process/parseUrls", method="post")
        div.input
            input(type="text", name="baseUrl")
        br
        div.action
            input(type="submit", value="Extract")
